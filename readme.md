# React App Folder Structure Templates

Welcome to the comprehensive collection of React application folder structure templates! This repository provides battle-tested, scalable folder structures for different React frameworks and platforms.

## 🎯 Why Use These Folder Structures?

### 📈 Enhanced Scalability
- **Feature-based organization** makes it easy to scale your application
- **Modular architecture** allows teams to work independently on different features
- **Clear separation of concerns** reduces code complexity as your app grows

### 🧹 Improved Maintainability
- **Co-located related code** makes features easier to understand and modify
- **Consistent structure** across projects reduces onboarding time for new developers
- **Clear file organization** makes debugging and refactoring more efficient

### 👥 Better Team Collaboration
- **Feature ownership** becomes clear with dedicated feature folders
- **Reduced merge conflicts** when teams work on separate features
- **Standardized patterns** improve code review quality

### 🚀 Development Efficiency
- **Faster navigation** with logical file organization
- **Reusable components** are clearly separated and easy to find
- **Path aliases** reduce import complexity and improve code readability

### 🧪 Testing & Quality
- **Isolated testing** of features becomes straightforward
- **Better code splitting** opportunities for performance optimization
- **Clear dependencies** make it easier to identify and fix issues

### 📱 Framework Optimization
- **File-based routing** takes full advantage of modern framework capabilities
- **Optimized for tree-shaking** to reduce bundle sizes
- **Framework-specific patterns** ensure you're following best practices

## 📁 Available Templates

### React Native Expo
**Perfect for mobile applications with modern routing and navigation**

[📱 React Native Expo Folder Structure →](./react-native-expo/README.md)

**Key Features:**
- Expo Router file-based routing
- Feature-based architecture
- Mobile-optimized asset organization
- Background services and global state management
- TypeScript support with comprehensive type definitions

**Best for:**
- Mobile applications
- Cross-platform development
- Apps requiring background services
- Projects using Expo ecosystem

## 🌟 Benefits of Feature-Based Architecture

### 🔧 Modular Development
Each feature is self-contained with its own:
- Components
- Hooks
- Services
- Types
- State management

### 📦 Easy Code Splitting
Features can be:
- Lazy loaded for better performance
- Developed and tested independently
- Extracted into separate packages if needed

### 🎨 Consistent Patterns
Every feature follows the same structure:
```
feature/
├── components/
├── hooks/
├── services/
├── store/
└── types.ts
```

### 🚀 Rapid Development
- Quick feature scaffolding
- Predictable file locations
- Reusable component patterns
- Standardized naming conventions
