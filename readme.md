# React App Folder Structure Templates

Battle-tested, scalable folder structures for React applications using feature-based architecture.

## 🎯 Why Feature-Based Architecture?

- **🚀 Scalable** - Easy to add features without restructuring
- **🧹 Maintainable** - Related code stays together
- **👥 Team-friendly** - Clear ownership and reduced conflicts
- **⚡ Efficient** - Faster development and better code splitting

## � Available Templates

| Framework | Status | Description | Link |
|-----------|--------|-------------|------|
| **React Native Expo** | ✅ Available | Mobile apps with Expo Router | [📱 View →](./react-native-expo/README.md) |
| **Next.js App Router** | 🚧 Coming Soon | Full-stack web apps with App Router | 🔜 |
| **Vite + React** | 🚧 Coming Soon | Fast development with Vite | 🔜 |
| **Create React App** | 🚧 Coming Soon | Traditional React SPA | 🔜 |
| **React Native CLI** | 🚧 Coming Soon | Native development without Expo | 🔜 |
| **Remix** | 🚧 Coming Soon | Full-stack with server rendering | 🔜 |

## �️ Core Structure Pattern

All templates follow this proven pattern:

```
src/
├── app/           # File-based routing (screens/pages)
├── features/      # Feature modules (auth, chat, etc.)
├── components/    # Shared UI components
├── assets/        # Static files
├── constants/     # App constants
├── lib/           # Third-party integrations
├── store/         # Global state
├── hooks/         # Global hooks
├── utils/         # Helper functions
├── types/         # TypeScript types
├── service/       # Background services
└── config/        # App configuration
```
